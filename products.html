							<h1>Cables</h1>
							<p>
									Often overlooked but nonetheless very important, cables are handy peripherals in our day-to-day life. Keeping this in mind, we at nesty have put attention to detail in coming up with cables that not only serve the purpose of having them but also are good in look and feel. 
									
									Our cables go well with our Car Chargers to give fire up your devices with fast charging on-the-go. The same cable can also be used to perform multimedia data transfer across your laptops, phones or tablets at optimal speeds. The flat cable skin keeps it from getting entangled and gives significant protection to the inner conductor from daily wear and tear. The overall high quality look and feel makes it an obvious choice for cables.
